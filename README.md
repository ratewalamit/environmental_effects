This repository contains all the relevant data used in the manuscript "Dark Matter distribution around satellites."

The directory structure is self-explanatory, i.e., the "catalog" directory contains data files for satellites and control sample of field galaxies. The "covariance_matrices" directory contains covariance matrices from shapenoise and Jackknife techniques, as indicated by the corresponding file names. We also provide our measurements obtained with the weak lensing pipeline and the posterior distributions from MCMC sampling in directories bearing signifying names.
