This repository contains the relevant data used in the manuscript "Dark Matter distribution around satellites."

The directory structure and content are self-explanatory, i.e., the "catalog" directory contains satellites and control sample data files used in the analysis. The "measurement" directory contains the signal and the covariance matrices obtained from shapenoise and Jackknife techniques for different bins used in the analysis, as indicated by the corresponding file names in the directory tree. We also provide the posterior distributions obtained from MCMC sampling in directories bearing signifying names
